## Q & I
- [ ] which ERC standard for NFT? -> so VITA is the ERC-20, and the NFT will get its own ticker?
- [ ] 'Through the Wormhole' episode
- [ ] "identified more than 10 FDA-approved medications that appear to have a strong effect on lifespan following analysis. The next step in the project will focus on optimising, repurposing and re-formulating the three drugs with the strongest and most significant impact on the human lifespan" - status?
- [ ] further thoughts on utility for token? -> staking incentives for NFTs?
- [ ] -> kind of a "launchpad"? -> if depending on service providers to join the DAO, isn't marketing the most important? -> people in longevity R&D prob not the "usual entrepreneur"? -> visionary and strategic view, judge of character skills needed? (like more social than professional knowledge?) -> tokenomics mechanisms: how does issueing happen when projects join the DAO? (how not dillutive? buy back and burn?)
- [ ] still a lot of Molecule in VitaDAO?
- [ ] why changed TGE from LBP on Balancer to Auction on Gnosis?
- [ ] who is Paul?
- [ ] where was the initial "spark" to connect longevity with blockchain? (prob something personal?)
- [ ] get into the team: Tim Ferriss? Peter Attia? Hamilton Morris? Paul Stamets? Kevin Rose?
- [ ] how does an *IP data asset* "look"?
- [ ] thoughts/vision from Ocean Protocol/Trent?
- [ ] tokenomics VITA?
- [ ] is the data from the Danish registry free? -> how to get more of this kind of data?
- [ ] how does the geographical component of the data weigh in, relevant? (ie for people living in say Japan or Poland)
- [ ] what about other variables/relations like data for food intake?
- [ ] wont we get into a "dilemma" of the project "dissolving" itself, when we perfect our knowledge about the influence or the causes of taking a therapeutic drug in the first place (prob comes w DD/evaulation of projects to fund)?
- [ ] "Our mortality is what separates us from the machines that we create." - sounds like that statement focuses on time. but machines arent forever either, nothing is. everything is impermanent. everything has its rhythm. so isnt it more the fact that we can think about mortality or say think about thinking, while machines cant?
- [ ] "Right now, we are a child. Learning to crawl, speaking our first words. Over time, we will walk, read and write, then we will run." - dont forget to dance!
- [ ] value estimation of IP as an asset?
- [ ] YT link on Anchor to correct
- [ ] 



## mission/purpose/USP
- R&D in the longevity space, coordinating actions for- and non-profits
- "being a cooperative vehicle for community-governed and decentralized drug development"
- "to support therapeutics development that does have a potentially commercializable angle and can generate intellectual property"
- "to democratize access to longevity"
- to integrate legal and licensing processes and assets into the governance of the DAO
- making it able to access specific data sets by owning VITA
- "worldâ€™s first decentralized intellectual property collective"
-> imagine patients being the funders of the drug development process
-> giving the members ownership of the *Intellectual Property IP* assets and data: to be tokenized as a [[NFT]], only moveable with approval of the DAO
-> think of yourself as a shelling point
- current: IP is filed in a monopolistic patent system, business model has barely evolved in the past century, preventing the open sharing of research data, disincentivizing collaboration and transparency, open source structures lack market exclusivity for incentivisation, critical early-stage funding is severely lacking and incentives between patients, researchers and industry are misaligned, price gouging when drugs make it to market, fund-raising a major time consumer for research group leaders
- to monetize owned data and IP rights
- there is "a race to centralize research progress in the hands of the few" in progress
- like a self-governing ETF composed of hundreds of early-stage longevity projects



## organization
### initiators
- [[Tyler Golato]]
- [[Paul Kohlhaas]]
- [[Morten Scheibye-Knudsen]]

### partners/backers
- [[Vitalik Buterin]]
- [[Ocean Protocol]]
- [[University Of Copenhagen]]
- service providers c3-03-07

### advisors
- [[David M. Wilson III]]
- [[Aubrey De Grey]]

### structure
- based on DAO model of [[MolochDAO]] and [[The LAO]], changing the idea from artwork to IP
- technical legal framework to attach IP to NFTs originates from Molecule

### components
#### 3 *core assets* (as):
- (as1) IP and data assets (patents, licenses), represented as NFT
- (as2) R&D data from funding research projects
- (as3) funds in treasury
#### 2 groups of *stakeholders* (st):
- (st1) patients
- (st2) researchers

#### 3 groups of *contributors* (c):
- (c1) *members*/token holders
-> govern the data repositories and IP asset PF
-> elect to issue tokens for research proposals

- (c2) *working groups* (wg):

	- (c2-wg-01) Awareness
	- (c2-wg-02) Governance
	- (c2-wg-03) Legal
	- (c2-wg-04) Longevity
	- (c2-wg-05) Ops
	- (c2-wg-06) Technical
	- (c2-wg-07) Tokenomics

	--> each group consisting of:
	
	- (c2-wg-xx-a) members with high availability and
	- (c2-wg-xx-b) a steward in a leading role/responsible for final decisions
	
		
- (c3) *service providers* (sp):
	- (c3-sp-01) [[Arctoris Ltd]]
	- (c3-sp-02) [[Curve Labs]]
	- (c3-sp-03) [[Decentralized Matter]]
	- (c3-sp-04) [[Keyko AG]]
	- (c3-sp-05) [[Linum Labs AG]]
	- (c3-sp-06) [[Molecule GmbH]]
	- (c3-sp-07) [[Scheibye-Knudsen Lab]]




#### token
- native token [[VITA]]
-> for governance (min. 1 VITA), holders obliged to adhere to code of conduct
-> can be gifted to reputable stakeholders to incentivize participation (via proposal, work, or purchase: ie a service provider or contract research organization providing preclinical development services, or running qPCR experiments)
-> TGE via [[Gnosis Auction]]


### competences

-   Molecule GmbH: _architecture, operations, awareness, business development, genesis IP, IP NFT workflow, legal_
-   Decentralized Matter: _communications, community management, marketing and DevOps_
-   Linum Labs AG: _smart contract development and deployment support_
-   Keyko AG: _tokenomics and system audit_
-   Curve Labs: _governance and system audit_
-   Arctoris Ltd: _contract research automation and R&D_
-   Scheibye-Knudsen Lab: _biotech lab work and R&D_

### processes


## incentivisation mechanisms
projects joining DAO-getting funded (~$50K - 1M) -> creating data, IP-issueing token/publish data on Ocean Marketplace -> ==VITA accrueing value by rights distribution/patient using pharmaceutical product (?)==




## road map
launchdate: April 2021
- [ ] Smart Contract Audit
- [ ] DAO Framework Presentation
- [ ] Genesis Contribution Event / Auction
- [ ] First DAO Proposals
- [ ] First DAO Vote Ends
- [ ] Transfer of NFT / IP
- [ ] Transfer of Funding to 1st Research Project
