#### project
- launchdate: April 2021
- initiators: [[Tyler Golato]], [[Paul Kohlhaas]], [[Aubrey De Grey]], [[Morten Scheibye-Knudsen]]
- partners/backers: [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Ocean Protocol]], [[University Of Copenhagen]], and service providers c3-03-07
- advisors: [[David M. Wilson III]]

#### token
- native token [[VITA]]
-> for governance (min. 1 VITA), holders obliged to adhere to code of conduct
-> can be gifted to reputable stakeholders to incentivize participation (via proposal, work, or purchase: ie a service provider or contract research organization providing preclinical development services, or running qPCR experiments)
-> TGE via [[Gnosis Auction]]

#### mission/purpose/USP
- R&D in the longevity space, coordinating actions for- and non-profits
- "being a cooperative vehicle for community-governed and decentralized drug development"
- "to support therapeutics development that does have a potentially commercializable angle and can generate intellectual property"
- "to democratize access to longevity"
- to integrate legal and licensing processes and assets into the governance of the DAO
- making it able to access specific data sets by owning VITA
- "worldâ€™s first decentralized intellectual property collective"
-> imagine patients being the funders of the drug development process
-> giving the members ownership of the *Intellectual Property IP* assets and data: to be tokenized as a [[NFT]], only moveable with approval of the DAO
-> think of yourself as a shelling point
- current: IP is filed in a monopolistic patent system, business model has barely evolved in the past century, preventing the open sharing of research data, disincentivizing collaboration and transparency, open source structures lack market exclusivity for incentivisation, critical early-stage funding is severely lacking and incentives between patients, researchers and industry are misaligned, price gouging when drugs make it to market, fund-raising a major time consumer for research group leaders
- to monetize owned data and IP rights
- there is "a race to centralize research progress in the hands of the few" in progress
- like a self-governing ETF composed of hundreds of early-stage longevity projects
- view of improvement proposals also as an entailing process to bundle decisions
-> ie to task internal/external partners (sevice providers), grant them autonomy
 
#### organization

[[DAO]] structure, no single entity can dictate or veto a decision against the will of the community

- stakeholders (st): (st1) patients, (st2) researchers

- 3 groups of contributors (c):

(c1) *members*/token holders
-> govern the data repositories and IP asset PF

(c2) *working groups*:

(c2-wg-01) Legal
(c2-wg-02) Technical
(c2-wg-03) Governance
(c2-wg-04) Tokenomics
(c2-wg-05) Awareness
(c2-wg-06) Ops
(c2-wg-07) Longevity

-> consisting of:
(c2-wg-xx-a) members with high availability
(c2-wg-xx-b) a steward in a leading role/responsible for final decisions

(c3) *service providers*:
(c3-01) [[Arctoris Ltd]]
(c3-02) [[Curve Labs]]
(c3-03) [[Decentralized Matter]]
(c3-04) [[Keyko AG]]
(c3-05) [[Linum Labs AG]]
(c3-06) [[Molecule GmbH]]
(c3-07) [[Scheibye-Knudsen Lab]]

#### partners/backing
- [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Ocean Protocol]], [[University Of Copenhagen]], and service providers c3-03-07
